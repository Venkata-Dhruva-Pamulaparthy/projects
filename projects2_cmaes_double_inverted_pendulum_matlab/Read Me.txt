This is a project that shows the evolution of a controller for the swing up of a coupled parallel double inverted pendulum, a highly nonlinear system. 
The evolution strategy used is called the Covariance Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy (CMAES).
The design of the above controller by traditional methods is not apparent.
It is assumed that a much simpler stability controller catches the pendulums after swing up and keeps them upright (Not shown here since it is not part of the project) 

To run the project you need MATLAB.

Steps:
1. Open the files in matlab and add to path.
2. Run the file named cmaes_pd. Watch the controller evolve as the performance index is minimized.
3. Once the run is complete you will get graphs showing the stabilization of each dimension of the six-dimensional problem.   
4.For more information and detailed theory of the concepts involved is provided in the project report (see pdf file).I could provide further clarifications during the interview.
